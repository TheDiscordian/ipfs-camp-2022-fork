# IPFS Implementations
Are you looking to choose the right IPFS implementation to build on? Do you want to find an IPFS implementation to work on? This track aims to answer both.

Meet the teams taking IPFS to the next level. Find an implementation that you can bet your project on, or if you dare, let yourself be nerd sniped into working on the protocol itself.

TIME	SPEAKER	INFO
13:00	@b5	Interplanetary Cambrian Explosion
A wave of new IPFS implementations has grown in the past year. This track introduction will give an overview of recent developments in IPFS implementaions, and how existing ones are adapting to meet new demands.


13:30	Paolo Insogana	Elastic IPFS

14:00	@lidel?	IPFS, the Spec

14:30		Break - 15 min

14:45	@ramfox	Iroh: Efficient IPFS in Rust
Overview of iroh, a next-generation implementation of IPFS


15:45	@guseggert	State of Kubo

16:15	@rklaehn	A new approach to IPFS pinning and caching
Ipfs-Embed is a small embeddable version of a subset of IPFS, written in rust. It is used in production in the German manufacturing industry.

This talk will present a novel API for pinning, caching and garbage collection that is designed for the use case of highly interactive and dynamic applications with soft real time requirements.

Afterwards there will be a discussion about advantages and disadvantages of this approach, and how it compares to the Kubo API.


13:00	@achingbrain	State of IPFS-in-JS
