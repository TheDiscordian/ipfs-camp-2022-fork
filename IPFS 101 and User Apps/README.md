# IPFS 101 and User Apps
This packed track will include both 1.5 hours of Learning IPFS 101 & Talks from User Apps built on IPFS to help spark your own ideas.

Learn IPFS 101 is a hands on session on getting started with IPFS, including what it is, how to set up an IPFS node, CLI commands, pinning, gateways and more. If you've been wanting to try out IPFS - now's your chance!

User Apps on IPFS focusses on the awesome decentralised apps that have been built on top of the IPFS protocol including Livepeer, Fleek, Peeranha, Huddle01 and more. Come and discover new apps you can use to decentralise your data life.

TIME	SPEAKER	INFO
13:00	Ryan Baumann	Breaking Free of the Client-Server Model with IPFS
An Introduction to IPFS, its key features and benefits


13:30	Lindsay Walker	Hands On with IPFS - Installing, using the CLI and implementing kubo in a boilerplate app
Lindsay Walker will lead a hands-on workshop to help you get up and running with IPFS


14:30	Max Boytsov	Fleek XYZ + IPFS Storage plugin Workshop
We’ll write a skeleton with dummy modules for IPFS Storage Plugin
We’ll start to fulfil the plugin, starting from its metadata and ending all the different methods being written with an SDK
Once the plugin file is finished, we’ll build the plugin library for it and import it into the fleek-xyz GraphQL module.
We’ll go to the Fleek.xyz UI to show:
How the newly created plugin is displayed in the list of storage plugins
How we’re initializing that plugin.

15:00	Akshit Gupta	Leveraging Crypto Storage Primitives for building Huddle01’s DRTC
While utilizing IPFS/Filecoin for storing recordings of huddle01 meetings, we came across the need for a solution to be able to upload, share and monetize videos in a piracy-resistant way and how huddle01 is building this easy-to-use video Infrastructure to revolutionize video storage and decentralized tools for private video hosting using huddle01’s powerful SDK.


15:25	Shannon	Livepeer

15:50	Yuriy Lukashevich	Peeranha: Organisation of knowledge in Web3
Information in Web3 is spread across fragmented communities in Discord, Slack and Telegram channels. That information is not exposed to Google search, hard to find, unstructured and not curated. And we have created a solution! Peeranha streamlines knowledge management & discovery in Web3, creates incentives for users to contribute, gives ownership of the knowledge back to the community and preserves it by storing on Polygon blockchain and Filecoin.


16:15	Logan Lentz, Alex Mirran	Openlinks - web3 Linktree
Why microsites on IPFS make seense and considering trade-offs and how those decisions affect IPFS in your applications.


16:25	Ryan Shahine	Portrait.gg - decentralised websites on IPFS
During this talk Ryan will give a deep-dive into how Portrait leverages IPFS and an on-chain registry to store and govern decentralized websites and how transferable DAOs may be established easily without coding experience.


16:35	Dave Montali	NIMI.eth - Web3 Social powered by IPFS
Nimi is a social aggregator, which allows users to effortlessly host on their ENS domains - powered by IPFS in the background. From hackathon to thousands of users we grew with IPFS and took a journey through the ecosystem. Today Nimi users have IPNS keys set on their ENS domains, allowing them to update their Nimi profiles without transaction fees.


16:45	Konrad Urban	Endless Jewellery: How IPFS can store memories in gold
Jewelry, but with a letter salad: NFC IOT NFT IPFS. How does it all fit together? Store memories and messages forever with IPFS. Record a voice message, which gets minted as an NFT that's stored on IPFS. The link is then put onto an NFC chip that's inside a physical piece of jewellery. This way, every time you tap your phone, you can see this message.


16:50	Chris Anderson	NFT.Storage - NFTUp
Upload files and directories with NFTUp!


16:55	Ally Haire	Wrap up
Quick wrap up before the Project Expo!
